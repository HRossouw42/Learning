# Learning
General learning repository

# What is this?

A repository for me to keep the bits and bobs of my learning via online tutorials and books.

# Why the weird folder names?
The idea of splitting 'resolutions' into [Yearly themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE&feature=emb_title) has always resonated with me. And the idea facilitates some large scale changes I want in my life. So every commit I make goes towards the themes I want to improve on.
